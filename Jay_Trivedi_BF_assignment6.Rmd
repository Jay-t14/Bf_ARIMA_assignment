# ARIMA
# Read in Data
# I am using nybirths.dat

# Convert it into Time Series Data

#See how the plot looks

# There are test to tell you if series is stationary
# ADF test says differences is required if p-value is > 0.05
adf.test(birthstimeseries)
# Kipps test says differences is required if p-value is < 0.05
kpss.test(birthstimeseries)
# There is also a function to tell you how much differences you need to do! 
# NSDIFFS only works for seasonal data
# I commented nsdiffs as my data is non seasonal 
#nsdiffs(birthstimeseries)
# However NDIFFS works with non-seasonal data
ndiffs(birthstimeseries)
#tsdisplay plots ACF,PACF and timeseries plot together. How cool!

#difference between acf and Acf is that Acf does not plot a spike at lag0.
# Did you notice this? 
# plot a correlogram
Acf(birthtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20)
# get the autocorrelation values
Acf(birthtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20,plot=FALSE)

# Arima and arima are similar except arima does not allow for the constant c
# unless d=0, and it does not return everything required for the forecast()
# function. Finally, it does not allow the estimated model to be applied 
# to new data (which is useful for checking forecast accuracy).
# Consequently, it is recommended that you use Arima() instead
# Lets call forecast. You can pass the confidence interval 
forecast(fit_Arima,h=5,level=c(99.5))
# or use defaults.
